## Summary:
Overall, the weather on this island seems to be sufficient enough to hold an ice cream shop. The weather on the island is stable, isn't too hot/cold, and doesn't outline any adverse effects to holding a shop here. Two additional queries that could be have been performed:
1. A query outlining specific years of the temperature, since current querys show a larger range (more recent uyears would be helpful).
2. A query showing a month by month overview of the average temperature from previous year (just one year) and the current year.
